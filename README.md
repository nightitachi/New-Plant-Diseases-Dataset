# Plant Disease Classification with Machine Learning ðŸŒ±

Introduction
This project explores the use of machine learning, specifically deep learning, for detecting and classifying plant diseases. Using a dataset of images that includes both healthy plants and those affected by various diseases, the aim is to build an efficient image classification model. This tool can assist farmers and agriculturists in early disease detection, helping to reduce crop losses and improve yield.
#Dataset
The dataset comprises labeled images of plants across multiple species and categories, such as:

#Healthy plants
Plants with specific diseases (e.g., leaf spots, mildew)
The dataset is organized into training, testing, and validation subsets, allowing for robust model development and evaluation.
#Goals
1-Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant images into specific categories.
2-Improve model accuracy using techniques such as data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
3-Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
#Features
Scalable Models: Choose from different architectures, including custom CNNs or pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).
Augmentation: Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zoom to enhance dataset diversity.
Performance Monitoring: Track training metrics and visualize progress.
Model Deployment: Export the trained model for integration into practical applications.
